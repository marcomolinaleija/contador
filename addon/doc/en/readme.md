# Counter, NVDA add-on

## General Description

This add-on will allow you to perform various functions with text.

Whether you have it on your clipboard or selected in a text box, this will work.

## Counter Functions

The following functions are available, both with a command layer and with an assignable gesture. You can access the gestures from NVDA menu > preferences > input gestures > counter.

Below are the functions.

- Count characters from the clipboard or a selected text.
- Count words from the clipboard or a selected text.
- Count lines from the clipboard or a selected text.
- View the text from the clipboard in an NVDA navigable window.

## Command Layer

The following keys perform an action while the command layer is active.

- c. Counts characters from the clipboard.
- alt+c. Counts characters from a selected text.
- p. Counts words from the clipboard.
- alt+p. Counts words from a selected text.
- l. Counts lines from the clipboard.
- alt+l. Counts lines from a selected text.
- m. Shows the text from the clipboard in an NVDA navigable window.

When performing an action with the command layer, it will exit, deactivating itself. If for any reason a key that does not have an associated function is pressed, it will beep indicating that no function has been assigned to the pressed key.
