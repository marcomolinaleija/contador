<h1>Counter, NVDA add-on</h1>
<h2>General Description</h2>
<p>This add-on will allow you to perform various functions with text.</p>
<p>Whether you have it on your clipboard or selected in a text box, this will work.</p>
<h2>Counter Functions</h2>
<p>The following functions are available, both with a command layer and with an assignable gesture. You can access the gestures from NVDA menu &gt; preferences &gt; input gestures &gt; counter.</p>
<p>Below are the functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Count characters from the clipboard or a selected text.</li>
<li>Count words from the clipboard or a selected text.</li>
<li>Count lines from the clipboard or a selected text.</li>
<li>View the text from the clipboard in an NVDA navigable window.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Command Layer</h2>
<p>The following keys perform an action while the command layer is active.</p>
<ul>
<li>c. Counts characters from the clipboard.</li>
<li>alt+c. Counts characters from a selected text.</li>
<li>p. Counts words from the clipboard.</li>
<li>alt+p. Counts words from a selected text.</li>
<li>l. Counts lines from the clipboard.</li>
<li>alt+l. Counts lines from a selected text.</li>
<li>m. Shows the text from the clipboard in an NVDA navigable window.</li>
